# Numeric-Matrix-Processor
Matrices have a wide range of applications in programming: they're used for digital image processing, graph representation and algorithms on a graph, graphic effects, applied math, statistics, and much more.  Since matrices are tables of numbers, they are usually presented in code as 2D-arrays. In this project, you will learn how to read and output matrices, do operations on them, and compute the determinant of a square matrix. At first, you will work with matrices with integer elements, and later the elements will be floating-point numbers.
